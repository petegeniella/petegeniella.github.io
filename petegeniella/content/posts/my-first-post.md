### 2020 Kona Dew Deluxe (size XL) Road/Gravel/Beach Hybrid bike

LIKE NEW, less than 50 miles on it. You’ve heard this story before –– I bought this in 2020, rode it a few times, and then it sat in my garage since. It’s an ideal long distance commuter bike but would also make for a killer beach bike or for cruising around on a sunny weekend. 

$600 CASH. My schedule is pretty open. 

The Kona Dew Deluxe is a reliable, easy-to-ride bike. It’s a safe and efficient ride every time you’re on it. Complete with upright and comfortable geometry, a reliable SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain, hydraulic disc brakes, & fenders. Fast 650b wheels take this refined ride through every type of weather with confidence.

The XL Frame is perfect for riders 5’11” - 6’5”
